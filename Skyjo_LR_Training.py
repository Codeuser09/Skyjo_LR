# ## 2 -  Problem Statement
# 
# Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.
# - You would like to expand your business to cities that may give your restaurant higher profits.
# - The chain already has restaurants in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
# - You also have data on cities that are candidates for a new restaurant. 
#     - For these cities, you have the city population.
#     
# Can you use the data to help you identify which cities may potentially give your business higher profits?
# 
# ## 3 - Dataset
# 
# You will start by loading the dataset for this task. 
# - The `load_data()` function shown below loads the data into variables `x_train` and `y_train`
#   - `x_train` is the population of a city
#   - `y_train` is the profit of a restaurant in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.   
#   - Both `X_train` and `y_train` are numpy arrays.

# In[6]:


# load the dataset
x_train = [191, 255, 225, 160, 264, 211]
y_train = [8, 2, 4, 6, -2, 12]

x_train = np.dot(x_train, 0.1)
# #### View the variables
# Before starting on any task, it is useful to get more familiar with your dataset.  
# - A good place to start is to just print out each variable and see what it contains.
# 
# The code below prints the variable `x_train` and the type of the variable.

# In[53]:


# print x_train
print("Type of x_train:",type(x_train))
print("Elements of x_train are:\n", x_train) 


# `x_train` is a numpy array that contains decimal values that are all greater than zero.
# - These values represent the city population times 10,000
# - For example, 6.1101 means that the population for that city is 61,101
#   
# Now, let's print `y_train`

# In[54]:


# print y_train
print("Type of y_train:",type(y_train))
print("Elements of y_train are:\n", y_train)  

# In[56]:


# Create a scatter plot of the data. To change the markers to red "x",
# we used the 'marker' and 'c' parameters
plt.scatter(x_train, y_train, marker='x', c='r') 

# Set the title
plt.title("Profits vs. Population per city")
# Set the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Card on the top of the deck')
# Set the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Card sum')
